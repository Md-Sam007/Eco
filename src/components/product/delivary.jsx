            <p className="mt-[20px] ">Most brand-new, unopened items are eligible for returns and full refunds within 30 days of delivery. Should the return stem from an error on our part (you received a damaged or wrong item, for example), we will additionally cover the cost of return postage.<br></br>
            <br></br>
            Once you provide your box to the return shipper, you should expect to get your refund within four weeks; however, you will often receive your refund sooner. This duration encompasses the transit time (5 to 10 business days) for us to receive your return from the shipper, the processing time (3 to 5 business days) for us to process your return, and the time your bank needs to prepare our reimbursement request (5 to 10 business days).</p>
            <h2 className="text-[1.4em] font-semibold mt-[20px]">SHIPPING :</h2>
            <p className="mt-[20px]">We are able to send to almost any address worldwide. Be aware that some products are subject to limitations and that shipments of some products to foreign locations are not permitted.<br></br>
            <br></br>

            Depending on the availability of your items and the shipping options you select, we will estimate shipping and delivery dates for you at the time of order placement. Shipping date estimates could show up on the shipping quotes page, depending on the shipping company you select.</p>
